    <h2>About Casey</h2>
    
    <div style="line-height: 1.8; color: var(--text-primary);">
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            Casey is a personal productivity app inspired by <strong>Casey Newton</strong>, editor of the Platformer newsletter and co-host of the <em>Hard Fork</em> podcast with Kevin Roose.
        </p>
        
        <h3 style="font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The Origin Story</h3>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            During an episode of Hard Fork, Casey Newton shared his personal productivity system—a combination of morning journaling, task management, and a unique concept he calls <strong>"blips"</strong>: quick thoughts and ideas captured throughout the day that randomly resurface to spark creativity and reflection.
        </p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            His approach struck a chord: simple, focused, and designed around clearing your head each morning rather than complex project management. It felt refreshingly human in a world of over-engineered productivity apps.
        </p>
        
        <h3 style="font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The System</h3>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Casey's productivity system has three core components:</p>
        
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; margin-left: 1.5rem; color: var(--text-secondary);">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong style="color: var(--text-primary);">Morning Journal</strong> — Start each day by clearing your head. Write freely about what's on your mind.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong style="color: var(--text-primary);">Task Management</strong> — Simple, actionable tasks. No over-planning. Just what needs doing today.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><strong style="color: var(--text-primary);">Blips</strong> — Quick thoughts, ideas, or notes you capture on the fly. The system randomly surfaces a few each day to spark new connections and prevent good ideas from disappearing into the void.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            This app is a faithful digital implementation of that system. No feature creep. No notifications. No gamification. Just the essentials for thinking clearly and getting things done.
        </p>
        
        <h3 style="font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The Philosophy</h3>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            Casey isn't here to guarantee gains in your productivity. It's not here to ensure you journal every day, or document every experience.
        </p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            <strong>Casey exists to get out of your way.</strong> For you to be present. Add what you need, ignore what you don't.
        </p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            Use it daily or weekly. Fill every field or just one. There are no streaks to maintain, no points to earn, no guilt if you skip a day. This is a tool that adapts to you—not the other way around.
        </p>
        
        <h3 style="font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The Name</h3>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            Named after Casey Newton himself—both as a tribute to his system and because it felt right.
