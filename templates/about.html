    <h2>About Casey</h2>

    <p>
        Casey is a personal productivity app inspired by <strong>Casey Newton</strong>, editor of the Platformer newsletter and co-host of the <em>Hard Fork</em> podcast with Kevin Roose.
    </p>

    <h3>The Origin Story</h3>

    <p>
        During an episode of Hard Fork, Casey Newton shared his personal productivity system&mdash;a combination of morning journaling, task management, and a unique concept he calls <strong>&ldquo;blips&rdquo;</strong>: quick thoughts and ideas captured throughout the day that randomly resurface to spark creativity and reflection.
    </p>

    <p>
        His approach struck a chord: simple, focused, and designed around clearing your head each morning rather than complex project management. It felt refreshingly human in a world of over-engineered productivity apps.
    </p>

    <h3>The System</h3>

    <p>Casey&rsquo;s productivity system has three core components:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Morning Journal</strong> &mdash; Start each day by clearing your head. Write freely about what&rsquo;s on your mind.</li>
        <li><strong>Task Management</strong> &mdash; Simple, actionable tasks. No over-planning. Just what needs doing today.</li>
        <li><strong>Blips</strong> &mdash; Ongoing topics, questions, or ideas you&rsquo;re tracking. The system randomly surfaces a few each day&mdash;a form of spaced repetition that keeps important themes alive.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This app is a faithful digital implementation of that system. No feature creep. No notifications. No gamification. Just the essentials for thinking clearly and getting things done.
    </p>

    <h3>The Philosophy</h3>

    <p>
        Casey isn&rsquo;t here to guarantee gains in your productivity. It&rsquo;s not here to ensure you journal every day, or document every experience.
    </p>

    <div class="pullquote">
        Casey exists to get out of your way. For you to be present. Add what you need, ignore what you don&rsquo;t.
    </div>

    <p>
        Use it daily or weekly. Fill every field or just one. There are no streaks to maintain, no points to earn, no guilt if you skip a day. This is a tool that adapts to you&mdash;not the other way around.
    </p>

    <h3>The Name</h3>

    <p>
        Named after Casey Newton himself&mdash;both as a tribute to his system and because it felt right.
